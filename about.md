I'm a third-year Statistics PhD student at Penn State with a keen interest in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and its potential applications in neuroscience and neuroimaging data analysis. This blog serves as a personal journal to document my evolving understanding of TDA, neuroscience, and neuroimaging data analysis techniques throughout my PhD journey.

Prior to joining Penn State, I completed a five-year integrated Master's program in Mathematics at the National Institute of Science Education and Research in Bhubaneswar, India.
