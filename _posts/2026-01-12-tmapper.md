Modeling real-world phenomena such as neural dynamics, population growth, and the spread of epidemics is of significant interest to researchers and practitioners. In this blog post, we will focus on phenomena that evolve over time. In other words, these phenomena result in time series data. Most models used to understand such phenomena fall into one of two categories - mechanistic models and data-driven models. Mechanistic models describing the phenomena of interest often involve complex non-linear dynamical systems. On the other hand, data-driven models
