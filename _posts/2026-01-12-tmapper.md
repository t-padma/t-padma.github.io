Modeling real-world phenomena such as neural dynamics, population growth, and the spread of infections is of significant interest to researchers and practitioners. In this blog post, I will focus on phenomena that evolve over time. In other words, these phenomena result in time series data. Throughout the blog, I use predator–prey dynamics as an example to explain the key ideas and concepts that come along the way. Most models used to understand such phenomena fall into one of two categories - mechanistic models and data-driven models.
