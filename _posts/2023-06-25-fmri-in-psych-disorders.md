There are three different types of fMRI studies - Task activation studies, Regional CBF studies, and Connectivity studies.[^1]

### Task-Activation studies
* The focus is on one or two localized functions of the brain.
* As mentioned in this [introductory post](https://t-padma.github.io/2023/06/23/fmri-intro.html), BOLD is a dimensionless and *indirect measure* of neuronal activity. The BOLD value in itself is not of interest when we are looking at Task-activation studies. Instead, we capture BOLD images when the person is still i.e. in the *resting-state* as well as while performing a given task i.e. during the *activation-state*. The difference between the two signals is associated with the given task.
* The entire brain needs to be imaged in order to identify the regions associated with the activity. The difference in signal is $\approx 2%$ to $3%$ above baseline.
* Possible sources of noise that add noise to the image: subject's movements (including respiration), scanner hardware-associated problems, neuronal activity due to unrelated task(s), change in the subject's behavior over time while performing the task, etc. 


### Connectivity Studies
* As mentioned earlier, task-activation studies focus on the $2-3 %$  increase in signal and totally ignore the *resting* brain signal. However, even the ``resting brain" is very dynamic in the sense that different anatomical regions of the brain are connected and there is a constant exchange of information within and across these regions.
* This led to the concept of **connectivity in brain function**. Several specific connectivity networks, called *resting-state networks* associated with specific functions have been identified.
* Connectivity in brain function is seen as similar fluctuations in signal between spatially different regions.
* Examples of resting state networks found across all subjects - Default Mode Network (DFN), attention network, auditory, visual, and temporal networks. The resting state approach allows us to image all the networks at once (unlike task-driven fMRI).
