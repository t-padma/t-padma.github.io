There are three different types of fMRI studies - Task activation studies, Regional CBF studies, and Connectivity studies.

### Task-Activation studies
* As mentioned in this [introductory post](https://t-padma.github.io/2023/06/23/fmri-intro.html), BOLD is a dimensionless and *indirect measure* of neuronal activity. The BOLD value in itself is not of interest when we are looking at Task-activation studies. Instead, we capture BOLD images when the person is still i.e. in the *resting-state* as well as while performing a given task i.e. during the *activation-state*. The difference between the two signals is associated with the given task.
* The entire brain needs to be imaged in order to identify the regions associated with the activity. The difference in signal is $\approx 2%$ to $3%$ above baseline.
* Possible sources of noise that add noise to the image: patient's movements (including respiration), scanner hardware-associated problems, neuronal activity due to unrelated task(s), change in subject's behaviour over time while performing the task, etc.
