The purpose of this post is to quickly introduce some basics about **functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging**, or fMRI for short. My main reference to understanding these basics is the first chapter of [The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-78191-4) by Nicole A. Lazar. Two introductory Neuroscience resources, which can be used for reference are:
* [Brain Anatomy](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/brain-anatomy), Queensland Brain Institute.
* [Foundations of Neuroscience](https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/neuroscience/), Casey Henley.

Before introducing fMRI, I will quickly summarize some important facts and the anatomy of the brain. Brain anatomy is mostly summarized pictorially for better understanding. 

Firstly, the brain has a left and a right hemisphere separated by the *corpus callosum* which can be thought of as the midline of the brain. The brain is made of three main parts: *forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain*. The picture below is taken from the [Brain basics](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-know-your-brain) page by NIH.
