**Neurovascular coupling** is one of the important principles on which fMRI image acquisition relies. Neurovascular coupling describes the relationship between neuronal activity and associated changes in blood flow. Angelo Mosso (1846–1910) was an early scientist trying to quantify human brain neuronal activity [^3]. He observed that brain function is followed by changes in blood flow. Although the resources at Mosso's time were limited, it is now known that activation of brain regions results in a local increase in blood flow
