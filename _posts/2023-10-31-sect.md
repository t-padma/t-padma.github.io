The objective of this blog post is to summarize my understanding of the theory and applications behind Smooth Euler Characteristic Transform (SECT) statistic which was first introduced by Crawford et al[^1] in 2020. The SECT statistic summarizes the shape information associated with an object as a collection of smooth curves that lie in a Hilbert space. The "niceness" of a Hilbert space allows us to use different tools from Functional Data Analysis (FDA).
