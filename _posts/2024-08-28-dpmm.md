## Introduction to Finite Mixtures
Data is often a heterogeneous mix of different types of groups. In such scenarios, we need variable(s) to identify the group or category to which the data point belongs. Finite mixture models are a popular choice to model data with known/unknown group structures. If the group structure is known, we have a classification problem while an unknown group structure points to a clustering problem. Generally, finite mixtures model data to be coming from a known/unknown number of parametric densities. This modeling assumption makes finite mixture models an intuitive choice for density estimation as well. For instance, skewed or heavy-tailed histograms might be better approximated using finite mixtures than symmetric distributions like the normal distribution.
