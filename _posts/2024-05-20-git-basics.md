The blog's primary objective is to provide a big picture of what Git Bash is, its importance, and how it is used on a Windows Operating System. Software Carpentry's course ["The Unix Shell"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro.html)[^1] is the primary reference for the blog. The necessary download instructions are given in [this link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell) under the title "The Bash Shell". Following these instructions on a Windows computer downloads Git BASH, Git GUI, and Git CMD. An alternative to Git BASH is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Note that most resources[^2][^3][^4] that I came across, focus on the Unix shell compatible with a Mac or Linux OS. Bash is one of the most popular Unix shells available. However, the Unix shell is not the default shell on a Windows system. Windows users can instead use Git BASH, which is a software that provides a Bash-like interface when interacting with Git.
