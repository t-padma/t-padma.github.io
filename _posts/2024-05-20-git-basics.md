The blog's primary objective is to provide a big picture of what Git Bash is, its importance, and how it is used on a Windows Operating System. Software Carpentry's course ["The Unix Shell"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro.html)[^1] is the primary reference for the blog. The necessary download instructions are given in [this link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell) under the title "The Bash Shell".Following these instructions on a Windows computer will download Git BASH, Git GUI, and Git CMD. An alternative to Git BASH is the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

**Shell** is a program that allows us to communicate with the computer using text-based commands. Shell is also called a **Terminal** or **Command-line**. The Unix shell is a kind of shell that is both a **command-line interface** and a scripting language. Note  that Unix is different from the Unix shell. Unix is an operating system, just like Windows and Macintosh. Bash, the most popular Unix shell, is the default shell on most Unix operating systems. However, the Unix shell is not the default shell on a Windows system. Windows users instead use Git BASH, a software that provides a Bash-like interface when interacting with Git. 
Although a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is easier to use, a Command-line Interface is more convenient to work with when we want to automate a large number of tasks.

Note that most resources[^2][^3][^4] that I came across, focus on the Unix shell compatible with a Mac or Linux OS. Moreover, learning Unix shell basics are important to work with Neuroimaging Software like AFNI and FSL.
