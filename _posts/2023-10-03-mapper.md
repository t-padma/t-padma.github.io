The objective of this blog is to document my understanding of the Mapper algorithm[^1] introduced by Singh et al. along with a review of available statistical literature on the Mapper. The textbook by Prof. Tamal Dey[^2] is an extremely helpful source for understanding the topological motivation behind Mapper. In particular, chapters 7 and 9 of the textbook focus on Mapper and its required background.
