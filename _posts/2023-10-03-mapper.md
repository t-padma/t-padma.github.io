The objective of this blog is to document my understanding of the Mapper algorithm[^1] introduced by Singh et al. along with a review of available statistical literature on the Mapper. The textbook by Prof. Tamal Dey[^2] is an extremely helpful source for understanding the topological motivation behind Mapper. In particular, chapters 7 and 9 of the textbook focus on Mapper and its required background. 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a finitely triangulable topological space endowed with the topology $\tau_{\mathcal{X}}$. Assume that $f:\mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function we want to study. If our intention is to obtain a topological summary, then one obvious option is to obtain barcodes[^3]:
* Let $X_t = \lbrace f^{-1}(-\infty, x_t]  \rbrace$ for $t \in \lbrace 0, \cdots, m \rbrace$ and $-\infty < x_0 < \cdots < x_m < \infty$ be a finite sequence of sub-level sets of $f$.
* This induces a sequence of homology groups (at different dimensions) connected by inclusion homomorphisms that are studied to obtain **barcodes** as the topological summary.

Another approach is to look at the **Reeb graph ($\mathcal{R}_f(\mathcal{X})$)** associated with the continuous function $f$. When $f$ is "nice", the Reeb graph of $f$ provides a one-dimensional topological summary of the function $f$.  Compared to barcodes, there is a loss of homological information with an increased ease in computing the Reeb graph of $f$. The statistical version of the Reeb graph for a point cloud data $X \in \mathcal{X}$ is called **Mapper** which helps us obtain a low dimensional combinatorial representation of the data. 

## Reeb graphs
$(\mathcal{X}, \tau_{\mathcal{X}})$ is a topological space and $f: \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. The overall idea behind Mapper is to look at the connected components of the level sets $f^{-1}(a)$ as $a$ varies in $(-\infty, \infty)$. An illustration of how to compute the Reeb graph corresponding to $f$ that denotes the height function from the baseline is given below:

An object of genus two is on the left while its corresponding Reeb graph w.r.t. the height function is on the right. Note that the points on (blue) lines parallel to the baseline correspond to the same function value i.e. they are contours of $f$. The number of connected components at each such contour line is counted. A node exists at a point where the number of connected components changes. Intuitively, we are "crushing" all the points of a contour line within a connected component into a single point. The resultant graph obtained this way is called the **Reeb graph associated with f**.

The intuition provided above can be made rigorous with the idea of **quotient topology** which "crushes points together" by identifying points using an equivalence relation. For $a \in \mathbb{R}$, define the level set at $a$ as 

$$
f^{-1}(a) = \lbrace x \in \mathcal{X} | f(x) = a  \rbrace \subset \mathcal{X} \text{ for } a \in \mathbb{R}
$$

Clearly, $f^{-1}(a) \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ which induces a subspace topology, $\tau_{f^{-1}(a)}$, on $f^{-1}(a)$:

$$
\tau_{f^{-1}(a)} = \lbrace f^{-1}(a) \cap U : U \in \tau_{\mathcal{X}}  \rbrace
$$

Define an equivalence relation $\thicksim$  on $\mathcal{X}$ as: for $x, y \in \mathcal{X}$, we say $x \thicksim y$ *iff*
- $f(x) = f(y) = \alpha$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$
- $x,y$ belong to the same connected component of $f^{-1}(\alpha)$
Then **Reeb graph** $R_f$ of $f:\mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the quotient space $\mathcal{X}/\thicksim$.

Let $\Phi: \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow R_f$ be the quotient map defined as $x \mapsto [x]$. Since $f: \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, the quotient map induces a continuous map $\tilde{f}: R_f \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined as $[x] \mapsto f(z)$ for $z \in \Phi^{-1}(x)$ such that $f = \tilde{f} \circ \Phi$.

If $f$ is "nice", then it can be proved that the corresponding Reeb graph is a finite $1$-dimensional regular CW-complex. In other words, it is a graph. Morse functions on compact smooth manifold and piecewise linear functions on compact polyhedrons are examples of such "nice" functions. Hence under such niceness conditions on $f$, we can view the Reeb graph $R_f$ as the underlying space of a $1$-dimensional cell complex that has a continuous function $\tilde{f}$ defined on it.
