The objective of this blog is to document my understanding of the Mapper algorithm[^1] introduced by Singh et al. along with a review of available statistical literature on the Mapper. The textbook by Prof. Tamal Dey[^2] is an extremely helpful source for understanding the topological motivation behind Mapper. In particular, chapters 7 and 9 of the textbook focus on Mapper and its required background. 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a finitely triangulable topological space endowed with the topology $\tau_{mathcal{X}}$. Assume that $f:\mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function we want to study. If our intention is to obtain a topological summary, then one obvious option is to obtain barcodes[^3]:
* Let $X_t = \lbrace f^{-1}(-\infty, x_t]  \rbrace$ for $t \in \lbrace 0, \cdots, m \rbrace$ and $-\infty < x_0 < \cdots < x_m < \infty$ be a finite sequence of sub-level sets of $f$.
* This induces a sequence of homology groups (at different dimensions) connected by inclusion homomorphisms that are studied to obtain **barcodes** as the topological summary.

Another approach is to look at the **Reeb graph ($\mathcal{R}_f(\mathcal{X})$)** associated with the continuous function $f$. When $f$ is "nice", the Reeb graph of $f$ provides a one-dimensional topological summary of the function $f$.  Compared to barcodes, there is a loss of homological information with an increased ease in computing the Reeb graph of $f$. The statistical version of the Reeb graph for a point cloud data $X \in \mathcal{X}$ is called **Mapper** which helps us obtain a low dimensional combinatorial representation of the data. 

## Reeb graphs
$(\mathcal{X}, \tau_{\mathcal{X}})$ is a topological space and $f: \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. The overall idea behind Mapper is to look at the connected components of the level sets $f^{-1}(a)$ as $a$ varies in $(-\infty, \infty)$. An illustration of how to compute the Reeb graph corresponding to $f$ that denotes the height function from the baseline is given below:

An object of genus two is on the left while it's corresponding reeb graph w.r.t. the height function is on the right. Note that each horizontal line parallel to the baseline is a level set w.r.t $f$.
 For $a \in \mathbb{R}$, define level set at $a$ as 

$$
f^{-1}(a) = \lbrace x \in \mathcal{X} | f(x) = a  \rbrace \subset \mathcal{X} \text{ for } a \in \mathbb{R}
$$

Clearly, $f^{-1}(a) \subseteq \mathcal{X}$ which induces a subspace topology, $\tau_{f^{-1}(a)}$, on $f^{-1}(a)$:

$$
\tau_{f^{-1}(a)} = \lbrace f^{-1}(a) \cap U : U \in \tau_{\mathcal{X}}  \rbrace
$$
