The contents of this post are predominantly based on the review paper by Otter et al. [^1] which discusses the computational aspects of Persistent Homology (PH). To begin with, the first four sections of the paper give a very good introduction to TDA without getting lost in unnecessary mathematical details. I believe that this can serve as a first introduction to PH for anyone who later wishes to understand PH with proper mathematical rigor. However, in the current post, I would like to focus on the first half of section five which familiarizes the reader with some of the **simplicial complexes** used while working with point-cloud data.
