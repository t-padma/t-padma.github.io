### Introduction

The contents of this post are predominantly based on the review paper by Otter et al. [^1] which discusses the computational aspects of Persistent Homology (PH). To begin with, the first four sections of the paper give a very good introduction to TDA without getting lost in unnecessary mathematical details. I believe that this can serve as a first introduction to PH for anyone who later wishes to understand PH with proper mathematical rigor. However, in the current post, I would like to focus on the first half of section five which familiarizes the reader with some of the **simplicial complexes** used while working with *point-cloud data*.

TDA deals with data that can be viewed as *finite metric spaces*. Such data sets are also referred to as point-cloud data sets. For instance, networks and digital images can be modeled as finite metric spaces. I found the lecture notes by [Prof. Vidit Nanda](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/)[^2] to be extremely helpful while learning some basics of computational topology. Following are some definitions as given by Lecture 1 of Vidit Nanda's notes.

Let $V \neq \emptyset$ be the set of vertices.
