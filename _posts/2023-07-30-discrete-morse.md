The blog introduces terms and results from Discrete Morse Theory that will eventually be helpful in understanding the paper **The Morse Theory of Cech and Delaunay Complexes** by U. Bauer and H. Edelsbrunner[^1]. The textbook I adhered to learn the basics is the textbook "**Organized Collapse: An Introduction to Discrete Morse Theory**" by Dmitry N. Kozlov[^2]
