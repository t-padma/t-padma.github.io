The fundamental building blocks of TDA are simplices that can be joined together to give a simplicial complex approximation of the underlying space $X$. Note that one of the most commonly observed ideas in mathematics is to generalize mathematical objects of interest. In other words, we wish to "peel off" a subset of the object's properties to understand the structure of the newly obtained "peeled-off object". For example, topological spaces are a generalization of metric spaces. 

In the current context, this idea leads to the question - *Can simplicial complexes be generalized?* The answer is yes, and the most generalized building blocks in TDA are topological spaces called **CW-complexes**, which is the object of interest in this blog.
