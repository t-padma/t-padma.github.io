The fundamental building blocks of TDA are simplices that can be combined to give a simplicial complex approximation of the underlying space $X$. One of the most commonly observed ideas in mathematics is to generalize mathematical objects of interest. In other words, we wish to "peel off" a subset of the object's properties to understand the structure of the newly obtained "peeled-off object". For example, topological spaces are a generalization of metric spaces. 

In the current context, this idea leads to the question - *Can simplicial complexes be generalized?* The answer is yes! The most generalized building blocks in TDA are topological spaces called **CW-complexes**, which will be the object of interest in this blog. This blog will also cover the concept of a **Polytopal Complex**, a generalization of the simplicial complex, and a special case of the CW-complex. The primary reference to understanding CW-complexes is Prof. [Jonny Evans'](http://jde27.uk/) [video lecture 4.01](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/tg/html/cw-01.html)[^1] on CW-complexes.

**Note:** The blog is mostly for an intuitive understanding with (minimal) mathematical rigor just enough to get an idea of the mathematical structure of CW-complexes.
