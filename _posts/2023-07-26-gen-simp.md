The fundamental building blocks of TDA are simplices that can be combined to give a simplicial complex approximation of the underlying space $X$. One of the most commonly observed ideas in mathematics is to generalize mathematical objects of interest. In other words, we wish to "peel off" a subset of the object's properties to understand the structure of the newly obtained "peeled-off object". For example, topological spaces are a generalization of metric spaces. 

In the current context, this idea leads to the question - *Can simplicial complexes be generalized?* The answer is yes! The most generalized building blocks in TDA are topological spaces called **CW-complexes**, which will be the object of interest in this blog. This blog will also cover the concept of a **Polytopal Complex**, a generalization of the simplicial complex, and a special case of the CW-complex. The primary reference to understanding CW-complexes is Prof. [Jonny Evans'](http://jde27.uk/) [video lecture 4.01](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/tg/html/cw-01.html)[^1] on CW-complexes.

**Note:** The blog is mostly for an intuitive understanding with (minimal) mathematical rigor just enough to get an idea of the mathematical structure of CW-complexes. 

### Abstract and Geometric Simplicial complexes
An **abstract simplicial complex** $\mathcal{X}$ is a collection of *finite* sets that are closed under taking subsets. Note that, the empty set $\emptyset$ is assumed to lie in $\mathcal{X}$. Although each element of the abstract simplicial complex must be a finite set, the cardinality of the complex in itself need not be finite, or even countable. The elements of the complex $\mathcal{X}$ are called **simplices**. \
The **vertices** of $\mathcal{X}$ are defined as the simplices that are singleton sets. The notation $\mathcal{X}_0$ is used to denote the set of all vertices. Again, the set $\mathcal{X}_0$ can be finite, countable, or even uncontable[^2]. The **dimension** of a simplex $\sigma$ is defined as $|\sigma| - 1$ i.e. one less than the cardinality of $\sigma$. Dimension of the complex $\mathcalX$ is the largest dimension among all simplicies. The subsets of a simplex are called **faces**, which also belong to $\mathcal{X}$ by definition. 

**Example 1:** An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertex and edge sets given by $V$ and $E$ respectively is actually a 1-dimensional abstract simplicial complex made up of 0-simplices contained in $V$ and 1-simplices in $E$. From the point of view of modeling interactions in a real-world process, an undirected graph can only capture up to pairwise interactions. On the other hand, an abstract simplicial complex generalizes a graph in the sense that it can model higher dimensional interactions as well.[^3]
