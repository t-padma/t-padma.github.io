The fundamental building blocks of TDA are simplices that can be joined together to give a simplicial complex approximation of the underlying space. One of the most commonly observed ideas in mathematics is to generalize mathematical objects. In other words, we wish to "peel off" a subset of the object's properties to understand the structure of the "peeled-off object".
