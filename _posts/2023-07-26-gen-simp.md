The fundamental building blocks of TDA are simplices that can be joined together to give a simplicial complex approximation of the underlying space $X$. Note that one of the most commonly observed ideas in mathematics is to generalize mathematical objects of interest. In other words, we wish to "peel off" a subset of the object's properties to understand the structure of the newly obtained "peeled-off object". For example, topological spaces are a generalization of metric spaces. 

In the current context, this idea leads to the question - *Can simplicial complexes be generalized?* The answer is yes! The most generalized building blocks in TDA are topological spaces called **CW-complexes**, which will be the object of interest in this blog. This blog will also cover the concept of a **Polytopal Complex** which is a generalization of the simplicial complex and a special case of the CW-complex. The primary reference to understanding CW-complexes is Prof. [Jonny Evans'](http://jde27.uk/) [video lecture 4.01](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/tg/html/cw-01.html)[^1] on CW-complexes.

**Note:** The blog is mostly for an intuitive understanding with (minimal) mathematical rigor just enough to get an idea of the mathematical structure of CW-complexes. 

### Abstract and Geometric Simplicial complexes
An **abstract simplicial complex** $\mathcal{X}$ is a collection of *finite* sets that is closed under taking subsets. Note that, the empty set $\emptyset$ is assumed to lie in $\mathcal{X}$.
